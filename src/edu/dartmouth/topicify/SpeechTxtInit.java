i appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor and i will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief i am delighted to be here and im particularly delighted to be here on this occasion we meet at a college noted for knowledge in a city noted for progress in a state noted for strength and we stand in need of all three for we meet in an hour of change and challenge in a decade of hope and fear in an age of both knowledge and ignorance the greater our knowledge increases the greater our ignorance unfolds despite the striking fact that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today despite the fact that this nation¹s own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole despite that the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension no man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come but condense if you will the 50000 years of man¹s recorded history in a time span of but a half century stated in these terms we know very little about the first 40 years except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them then about 10 years ago under this standard man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels christianity began less than two years ago the printing press came this year and then less than two months ago during this whole 50 year span of human history the steam engine provided a new source of power newton explored the meaning of gravity last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power and now if americas new spacecraft succeeds in reaching venus we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight this is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old new ignorance new problems new dangers surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships as well as high reward so it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest to wait but this city of houston this state of texas this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them this country was conquered by those who moved forward  and so will space william bradford speaking in 1630 of the founding of the plymouth bay colony said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage if this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything it is that man in his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred the exploration of space will go ahead whether we join in it or not and it is one of the great adventures of all time and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions the first waves of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space we mean to be a part of it  we mean to lead it for the eyes of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planets beyond and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and peace we have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction but with instruments of knowledge and understanding yet the vows of this nation can only be fulfilled if we in this nation are first and therefore we intend to be first in short our leadership in science and in industry our hopes for peace and security our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort to solve these mysteries to solve them for the good of all men and to become the worlds leading space faring nation we set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won and they must be won and used for the progress of all people for space science like nuclear science and all technology has no conscience of its own whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man and only if the united states occupies a position of pre eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war i do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea but i do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours";
